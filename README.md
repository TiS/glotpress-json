# GlotPress `.json` support

A plugin for the [GlotPress WordPress plugin](https://github.com/GlotPress/GlotPress-WP) that adds support for exporting `.json` files, ideally in a [Jed](https://github.com/SlexAxton/Jed)-compatible format.

See GlotPress issue [#523](https://github.com/GlotPress/GlotPress-WP/issues/523) and WordPress core ticket [#20491](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/20491).
